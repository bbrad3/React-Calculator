# React-Calculator
> This is a calculator built with React to practice the basics of React. Plus this project has been on my todolist for a while, and React seems like the perfect tool for the job!


## Focus
The main focus of this project is to practice:
- writing function components
- using props
- implimenting state

## TODO
- [x] Build calculator layout in CSS
- [x] When clicked, buttons can talk to screen input
    - [x] Answer displays when enter is clicked
- [x] Create component nesting as necessary
- [x] Create logic for simple calculations
- [x] Create logic for complex calculations

## Stretch
- [] Modal text moves R-L through modal
- [] Answers show up when a computation is possible (without clicking enter)
- [] keyboard events control calculator
